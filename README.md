# Arthos CLI

Arthos CLI is a command line interface to initialize the WordPress plugin boilerplate that I made. It is built thanks to the [Laravel Zero framework](https://laravel-zero.com).

## Installation

Usually, it should be included in the WP plugin boilerplate, but if you want to use it separately, you can do it by yourself.
